# Assignment
My program is based on the naive bays algorithm. It takes in a grid of data formatted in a certain way; 
Title	Title	Title of dependant info
Possible outcome	Possible outcome	Possible outcome
Possible outcome	Possible outcome	Possible outcome
 Then it dynamically creates relevant objects to store the data, furthermore, created a gui based on the possible answers to the data base. Then using radio button, you select any combination of symptoms and it tells you the probability of you being sick with tonsillitis. I tried to have as little hard coding in the project as possible so that code reuse will be a relatively simple matter.
